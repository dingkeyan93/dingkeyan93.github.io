      <description>&lt;p&gt;Image quality assessment (IQA) aims to quantify human perception of image quality. The development of objective IQA metrics is a fundamental problem for both human and computational vision, and is of paramount importance in a variety of real-world applications, such as image restoration, object recognition, medical imaging, and visual surveillance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past decades, most proposed IQA methods are highly sensitive to differences between images of the same texture, even when these are nearly indistinguishable to a human observer. The underlying reason is the reliance on perfect alignment. Two samples of the same texture (e.g., two cropped regions taken from an image of a field of flowers) will differ substantially in the precise arrangement of their features, but can appear nearly the same to the human visual system (HVS). We present the first full-reference IQA metric that is invariant to visually similar textures and insensitive to mild local and global geometric distortions —— &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07728&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Deep Image Structure and Texture Similarity (DISTS) index&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
